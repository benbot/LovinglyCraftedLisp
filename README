# Lovingly Crafted Lisp

## What is this?
I've been reading a book on writing interpreters and wanted to try out implementing a very small lisp.

The goal, right now, is to make a little text based calculator in LCL.

## Why Deno?
I work with typescript for my day job, so it's easy for me to whip up something fast in it. 
Plus I like how flexible it is.
